# Backlog

The queue only. Session findings live in `notes/session-findings-archive.md`;
topic notes in `notes/` supersede it. **Rewrite this file, never append to it.**
It rotted once by being appended to until a stale "M4 in progress" header sat on
top of 1570 lines of findings.

No status claim here that a command cannot check. Where one can, cite it.

## Ordering principle

Gameplay-first ordering, seam-level execution. Sequence by what blocks gameplay,
but fix at the seam that also buys speed and sound, rather than a symptom patch
that gets thrown away. Reaching gameplay is not the end goal.

    song load fix  ->  gameplay reachable  ->  Rnd seam  ->  playable speed
                                               (also retires M7 VU work)

## Now

**Song load: `StreamEE::mState` is pinned at 2.** Ready requires 3, 4 or 5.
Measured over 3600 probe calls, three objects, each walking 1 -> 2 and freezing.
This is the only thing between the current build and `game_screen`.

Open: what advances 2 -> 3, and whether anything outside `Poll__8StreamEE` writes
`+0x4c`. `gh2-decomp` has the field and enum but not `Poll`, so this is
disassembly plus a probe. Full gate chain and evidence in
`notes/song-load-crash.md`.

## Next

**Progress oracle.** The foundational item, because it is what lets work run
unattended. `gh2-decomp` reaches 43% unattended because it has a binary verifier;
ghpc has none, so every session ends with a human judging whether progress
happened. Most of it already exists: `GHPC_PAD_DRIVE` emits an ordinal screen
ladder every run, and `checkrun.sh` already retries to tell a hang from a
regression. Missing: a tracked high-water mark to diff against instead of a fixed
target, a sub-rung state vector for when the screen does not move, and a
re-measured boot success rate. `checkrun.sh` records boot hanging roughly 2 in 3
runs when it was written; three runs on 2026-09-09 all reached `loading_screen`,
which is not a measurement. An agent loop on a 2-in-3 oracle will thrash.
Design in `.planning/2026-09-09-work-spine-design.md` section 2.

**Override layer.** No hand-written function body can survive a build today:
staging does `rsync --delete` from generated output into a gitignored
`ps2xRuntime/src/runner/`. This is very likely what produced the `DataArray`
workaround that existed only as a stale object file with no source. Design in
`.planning/2026-09-09-work-spine-design.md`. Must fail the build, not warn, when
an override's target no longer exists.

**Rnd seam.** Playback is at 39.2% of realtime (23.5 vblanks/sec vs 60,
`GHPC_EERATE=60`) because rasterisation runs on the EE thread and guest time is
gated on the EE cycle counter. Needs ~2.5x rasteriser throughput, which
micro-optimisation will not deliver. A native GL or Vulkan backend at the `Rnd`
layer also makes VIF1, VU1, GIF, MFIFO and the GS rasterizer dead code. Do not
"fix" the clock by firing vblank on the host deadline alone; see the archive.

## Later

- **Boot intro skip.** Unverified hypothesis: the sequence is DTA-driven and
  skippable as a data-layer change. One cheap check with `scripts/dtb.py`. Would
  also dodge the video seam, since `PsMovie`/`Video` drive the IPU outside `Rnd`.
- **Video seam.** Only if the intro is not skippable.
- **M8 input.** HID guitar, calibration, latency against a tuned PCSX2.
- **GH1 and 80s.** Symbolized debug builds in `work/elf-debug/`. GH1 has 8,433
  symbols against GH2's 12,663, suggesting an earlier prototype. Verify before
  assuming parity.
- **SPU handshake stall.** Real and unfixed, but proven not to block the song
  load: `GHPC_SYNTH_ACK=1` removes exactly `SPUSendBusy` and `SynthPoll` from the
  working set and changes nothing else.

## Deferred

- **Retargeting the retail ELF.** Undecided, and it changes how every stage
  works. See `NORTHSTAR.md`, which calls this the biggest gap between the aim and
  reality.
- **Upstreaming.** Not until the port works. Patch 0003 (`isStubFunction`
  denylist) is the general fix covering all four name-collision mechanisms.
  Patch 0001 (`GetRomName` bounds) is a memory-safety fix whose decision to
  ignore `$a1` was derived from one caller in one game and needs disclosing.
- **Audit the remaining 247 stubs** for the same collision class.
- **Shipping target.** Development uses debug builds, which carry asserts and
  debug paths. Undecided.
- **Mod support.** In the aim, not started.

## References

- `gh2-decomp` (sibling repo) is a **reference clone, never a drop-in**, the same
  status `NORTHSTAR.md` gives `third_party/`. It targets byte-matching with
  32-bit GCC; ghpc builds native. When ghpc hits a function it must understand,
  check there for the name and shape first, then disassemble. Do not build a sync
  mechanism. It supplied `mState` at `0x4c` and `kPlaying`/`kStopped` for the
  song load work, and did not have the function that was actually blocking.
- `ps2ResolveGuestPointer` never fails. Out-of-range addresses are masked back
  into RAM and it returns true, so `getMemPtr` cannot reject a bad pointer. Any
  syscall taking a guest length must bound it itself.
- The `File/CD` debug tab exposes a `cdImage` field that nothing sets. No CLI
  flag or env var exists for it; the game-override hook is the intended path.
- Diagnostics have two known defects: `call_hist_dump` splices concurrent stderr
  into its own output, and `EeScheduler.cpp` still masks guest addresses to 25
  bits under a 128MB map. Both in `notes/song-load-crash.md`.
