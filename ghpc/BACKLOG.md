# Backlog

The queue only. Session findings live in `notes/session-findings-archive.md`;
topic notes in `notes/` supersede it. **Rewrite this file, never append to it.**
It rotted once by being appended to until a stale "M4 in progress" header sat on
top of 1570 lines of findings.

No status claim here that a command cannot check. Where one can, cite it.

## Ordering principle

Gameplay-first ordering, seam-level execution. Sequence by what blocks gameplay,
but fix at the seam that also buys speed and sound, rather than a symptom patch
that gets thrown away. Reaching gameplay is not the end goal.

    song load fix  ->  gameplay reachable  ->  Rnd seam  ->  playable speed
                                               (also retires M7 VU work)

## Now

**The song load and the chart are done. The `Rnd` seam is the only thing between
here and playable.** Measured 2026-09-10 on a stock build with no probes: rung 9
held, `song_tick` 0.000 -> 737.085, `song_tick_advanced: yes`, zero asserts and
zero guest exits across 7200 seconds. Evidence kept in
`notes/evidence/2026-09-10-chart-advances.json` and `.log` rather than in
gitignored `work/`.

It is not playable and not near it. `StartGame` lands about 85 minutes after the
song is chosen because guest time advances at roughly 0.0019 seconds per real
second. The chart is correct and 500x too slow.

The cost is VU1 interpretation, confirmed by volume (1,905,500 VU1 stores per
game frame against 4,289 per menu frame) and by a live profile dominated by
`VU1Interpreter`. `GSCpuBackend::WritePixel` sits well below it. So the native GL
or Vulkan backend at the `Rnd` layer is the right target and it is the whole
target.

**Measure a release build before sizing that work.** Every throughput number
here is `build-debug`, and the profile shows `fwrite` plus iostream formatting
taking a real slice. This is still the cheapest next thing.

**Fix the measurement hole first, though.** `song_tick_advanced` is only
observable in a multi-hour run, so `progress.py` cannot score the project's own
goal in a 300s round: the recorded mark has no `song_tick` in its detail at all.
Either the oracle needs a way to record a long run's result, or the count-in
needs a supported way to be shortened for tests. Without one of those, the next
person cannot tell a regression here from a slow day.

Also cheap and pending: cache three `getenv` calls in the VIF1 hot path
(`ps2_vif1_interpreter.cpp:947` per MSCAL, plus 816 and 901), 45 profile
samples; and lower the `[ghpc/song]` heartbeat from every 120th call, which at
this frame rate is one sample per ten minutes.

## Next

**Override layer.** No hand-written function body can survive a build today:
staging does `rsync --delete` from generated output into a gitignored
`ps2xRuntime/src/runner/`. This is very likely what produced the `DataArray`
workaround that existed only as a stale object file with no source. Design in
`.planning/2026-09-09-work-spine-design.md`. Must fail the build, not warn, when
an override's target no longer exists.

**Rnd seam.** Playback is at 39.2% of realtime (23.5 vblanks/sec vs 60,
`GHPC_EERATE=60`) because rasterisation runs on the EE thread and guest time is
gated on the EE cycle counter. Needs ~2.5x rasteriser throughput, which
micro-optimisation will not deliver. A native GL or Vulkan backend at the `Rnd`
layer also makes VIF1, VU1, GIF, MFIFO and the GS rasterizer dead code. Do not
"fix" the clock by firing vblank on the host deadline alone; see the archive.

## Later

- **Video seam.** Deprioritised: `scripts/bootskip.py --on` skips the intro
  video entirely, so the IPU seam is not on the path to gameplay.
- **M8 input.** HID guitar, calibration, latency against a tuned PCSX2.
- **GH1 and 80s.** Symbolized debug builds in `work/elf-debug/`. GH1 has 8,433
  symbols against GH2's 12,663, suggesting an earlier prototype. Verify before
  assuming parity.
- **SPU handshake stall.** Real and unfixed, but proven not to block the song
  load: `GHPC_SYNTH_ACK=1` removes exactly `SPUSendBusy` and `SynthPoll` from the
  working set and changes nothing else.

**Boot skip is available and doubles iteration speed.**
`ghpc/scripts/bootskip.py --on` flips one 11 byte symbol in `ui/gen/init.dtb` so
boot goes straight to `main_screen`. Measured: `main_screen` at t=6.3 instead of
t=38.8, `loading_screen` at t=41.6 instead of t=86.3, menu fully navigable.
Reversible (`--off` restores byte-identical) and idempotent. **Caveat:** it skips
whatever `bootup_load` initialises, so confirm any song-load or audio repro under
`--off` before trusting it.

## Deferred

- **Retargeting the retail ELF.** Undecided, and it changes how every stage
  works. See `NORTHSTAR.md`, which calls this the biggest gap between the aim and
  reality.
- **Upstreaming.** Not until the port works. Patch 0003 (`isStubFunction`
  denylist) is the general fix covering all four name-collision mechanisms.
  Patch 0001 (`GetRomName` bounds) is a memory-safety fix whose decision to
  ignore `$a1` was derived from one caller in one game and needs disclosing.
- **Audit the remaining 247 stubs** for the same collision class.
- **Shipping target.** Development uses debug builds, which carry asserts and
  debug paths. Undecided.
- **Mod support.** In the aim, not started.

## References

- `gh2-decomp` (sibling repo) is a **reference clone, never a drop-in**, the same
  status `NORTHSTAR.md` gives `third_party/`. It targets byte-matching with
  32-bit GCC; ghpc builds native. When ghpc hits a function it must understand,
  check there for the name and shape first, then disassemble. Do not build a sync
  mechanism. It supplied `mState` at `0x4c` and `kPlaying`/`kStopped` for the
  song load work, and did not have the function that was actually blocking.
- `ps2ResolveGuestPointer` never fails. Out-of-range addresses are masked back
  into RAM and it returns true, so `getMemPtr` cannot reject a bad pointer. Any
  syscall taking a guest length must bound it itself.
- The `File/CD` debug tab exposes a `cdImage` field that nothing sets. No CLI
  flag or env var exists for it; the game-override hook is the intended path.
- Diagnostics have two known defects: `call_hist_dump` splices concurrent stderr
  into its own output, and `EeScheduler.cpp` still masks guest addresses to 25
  bits under a 128MB map. Both in `notes/song-load-crash.md`.
